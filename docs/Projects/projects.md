# Projects

###**1. Model-Based Design of Vehicle Direction Detection System Using Simulink**

- **Description:**I developed a Simulink model to determine vehicle direction (left, right, or straight) by integrating steering yaw input with camera-detected road sign data. I structured the model into modular subsystems, tagged requirements for traceability, and managed calibration parameters using Simulink Data Dictionary (SLDD). Additionally, I configured the model for embedded C-code generation, demonstrating fundamental ADAS component design using model-based development techniques.
